 # Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection Using Deep Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Detection project, where we've spearheaded multiple deep learning projects aimed at enhancing image recognition capabilities using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our efforts have resulted in a significant 20% increase in accuracy and a commendable 12% reduction in the overall error rate.

## ASD Detection

We've developed an advanced ASD Detection system that achieves exceptional validation accuracies across various state-of-the-art CNN architectures:

- VGG16: 93.75%
- VGG19: 96.00%
- VGGFaces: 92.50%
- Inception V3: 97.50%
- ResNet50: 97.50%

## Dataset and Model Links
